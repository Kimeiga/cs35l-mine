Compiler compiles to .o obj (machine instructions) files, and linker will generate executable (link all modules together and resolve address)


Static Library
each program has own copy of library, takes up more space in memory, tied to specific version of the lib.

Shared Library
Shared by multiple programs, lower memory footprint, new version of lib doesn't require a recompile of the source code

dynamic linking is loading the library when needed, but dynamic load is loading library when needed
both are only performed during runtime
