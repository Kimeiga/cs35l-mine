1. The network is still secure because it is encrypted with a public
key, and the private key would only be possessed by the party receiving the
message. The private key cannot be accessed by a third party.

If the observers had our keystrokes, and I logged in to the ssh with a password,
there could be an issue because then the observers would be able to use
the password to get the private key and then decrypt the data.

If they had our usb, they would have our private keys in the .ssh folder and
could decrypt all the messages.

2. The gpg2 --verify command verifies that the public key and signature agree.
If a third party intercepted the package and resigned it with a public key,
the verification would still be valid but the package would no longer be
only touched by the right person.

A solution to this problem would be to have a third party verify the proper 
creators of the files rather than relying on only a public key and signature.
