I created an input file with about 100 lines of frobnicated
text and sorted it with the different implementations
of sfrob

time ./sfrob <input
real    0m0.003s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.002s

time ./sfrobu <input
real    0m0.013s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.010s

time ./sfrobs <input
real    0m0.007s
user    0m0.006s
sys     0m0.005s

time ./sfrobu -f <input
real    0m0.019s
user    0m0.005s
sys     0m0.008s

time ./sfrobs -f <input 
real    0m0.007s
user    0m0.003s
sys     0m0.007s
