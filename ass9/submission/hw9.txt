I cloned the repo again for this portion of the assignment

$ git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

I checked out version 3.0 of Diffutils and branched

$ cd diffutils
$ git checkout v3.0 -b quote

I then installed my patch into the quote branch with the patch command.

$ patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

the only files modified were the 6 I modified.

I used add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a) to
create a change log for the patch.

$ emacs
$ C-x 4 a

I entered all 6 modified files followed by a brief description
        * src/cmp.c:    Replaced graves with apostrophes
        * src/diff.c:   Replaced graves with apostrophes
        * src/diff3.c:  Replaced graves with apostrophes
        * src/dir.c:    Replaced graves with apostrophes
        * src/sdiff.c:  Replaced graves with apostrophes
        * src/util.c:   Replaced graves with apostrophes

I then add all files to the commit and commit with the message
provided by the changelog.

$ git add .
$ git commit -F \#CHANGELOG#

I now run git format-patch to generate the patch

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

I was working with Rishan Girish. 
His UID is 905016242.
We set each other our formatted-patch.txt files via scp.

The scp command was run from Rishan's computer

$ scp formatted-patch.txt hakan@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu:~/cs35l/ass9/diffutils/

then he created a partner branch

$ git checkout v3.0 -b partner

then he applied the patch

$ git am --abort
$ git am < formatted-patch.txt

I then tested this patch by remaking diffutils.

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

I verified the patch with the following commands

$ ./src/diff --help
$ ./src/diff . -

These commands produced messages with ' characters
rather than leading ` characters, which means that the patch worked.

I also verified that the log works 

$ git log

Now I ran git distdir and verified the contents of diffutils*

$ make distdir
$ cd diffutils*
$ emacs ChangeLog

the correct last changelog addition is present

To reach the emacs git repository, I ssh'ed with -X into the linux
server and navigated to it.

$ ssh -X hakan@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
$ cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
$ gitk

Within gitk, I found the correct commit, screenshotted it,
and then wrote about the window structure in a text file.
