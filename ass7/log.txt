I teamed up with my classmates Will Fehrnstrom and Andrew Battat.

First I downloaded an image of Debian on my microSD card and flashed my
beaglebone. I then connected it to my computer and downloaded the drivers.
I used putty to ssh into the beaglebone and verified that openssh-server
and openssh-client were installed.

- SERVER

I generated public and private keys with ssh-keygen. I stored them in
~/.ssh/is_rsa, the default location.

I then created an account on the server for the clients, my partners, with
sudo useradd -d /home/<directory> -m <username>`. I used the username
"will", the home directory "will", and password "wfehrnstrom". I also created
a user "andrew", the home directory "andrew", and password "abattat".
In each directory I created an .ssh directory with the permissions using
sudo mkdir .ssh. I used chown and chmod to set the owner of the files to
their respective users.

sudo useradd -d /home/will -m will
sudo passwd wfehrnstrom

sudo useradd -d /home/andrew -m andrew
sudo passwd abattat

cd /home/will/
sudo mkdir .ssh

sudo chown -R will .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

cd /home/andrew/
sudo mkdir .ssh

sudo chown -R andrew .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh


I found the ip of my Beaglebone with ifconfig

ifconfig

- CLIENT

After they connected to my beaglebone, I worked as the client to connect to
each of their beaglebones.

I generated new public and private keys and stored the public key
in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

ssh-keygen

I then copied my public key to their server for key-based authentication.

ssh-copy-id -i hakan@192.168.43.14

I added the private key to the authentication agent

ssh-add

I logged into the server and provided the password "halpay"

ssh -X hakan@192.168.43.14

I added the -X option to enable X11 session forwarding to enable graphical
display of commands I run on the server.

I ran firefox on the remote host and a window opened on my computer to firefox.
I tried wtih with xterm and gedit as well.

Thus we have successfully configured the clients/servers in our group for
securly logging into each other's beaglebones.
