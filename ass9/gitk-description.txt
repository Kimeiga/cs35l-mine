The top window shows all commits with three columns,
containing the descriptions, name and emails, and dates
respectively. It starts from the HEAD and grows down
toward older commits.

The bottom pane contains information about the current
commit selected. The bottom left pane shows a diff
of the files, and the bottom right pane shows a list
of the changed files.
