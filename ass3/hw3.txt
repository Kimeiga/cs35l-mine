Q1:

In order to inspect how fast the buggy and patched
ls -a -A commands are, I used the time command to store
their times in bash variables and then echoed them
with the following commands

buggyTime="$(time ( ./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -a -A )
2>&1 1>/dev/null )"

patchedTime="$(time ( ./coreutils-8.29/src/ls -a -A )
2>&1 1>/dev/null )"

echo $buggyTime
echo $patchedTime

the buggy ls had the following results:

real 0m0.003s user 0m0.001s sys 0m0.001s

the patched ls had the following results:

real 0m0.003s user 0m0.000s sys 0m0.002s

They have the same real time, and about
the same user and system times. It does
not appear that the patch has slowed
or sped up the command significantly.


Q2:

The patched version of ls probably will not introduce
problems with applications, unless those applications
rely on the command ls -a -A to produce . and ..

Q3:

There is no output because there's nothing in dev/null

Q4:

When running it with Python 3, you get the following
error:

  File "randline.py", line 69
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax


This is because in Python 2 you could iterate over an
exception, but this has been fixed in Python 3.
