I copied the diffutils from  ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils
with

$ git clone  ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

I entered diffutils and placed the git log in git-log.txt

$ cd diffutils
$ git log > git-log.txt

Then I generate a list of tags used for Diffutils using
the “git tag” command.

$ git tag > git-tag.txt

I used grep to find the correct commit

$ git log --grep "maint: quote 'like this'"

It is commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f

I get details on the commit

$ git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f

I generated a patch for that single commit with
git format-patch -1

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
 > quote-patch.txt

I get version 3 of diffutils

$ git checkout v3.0

I applied quote-patch

$ patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt

I got the status

$ git status

many files have been modified


I used vc-diff and vc-revert to revert changes to files without .c extensions.
I opened emacs on all relevant files.

emacs ms/config.bat; emacs ms/config.site; emacs po/en.po;
emacs src/diff.h; emacs src/system.h; emacs tests/help-version;
emacs NEWS; emacs README; emacs TODO; emacs doc/diagmeet.note

I reverted changes with C-x v u, then exited with C-x C-c to the next file.

I revert any changes to comment hunks:

emacs src/diff3.c; emacs src/dir.c; emacs src/ifdef.c; emacs src/io.c;
emacs src/sdiff.c; emacs src/side.c; emacs src/util.c; emacs src/analyze.c;
emacs src/cmp.c; emacs src/context.c; emacs src/diff.c

I used C-x v = (vc-diff) to open the diff reverted comment changes with C-u C-c C-a
(revert current hunk), the opposite of C-c C-a (diff-apply-hunk) which applies the changes.
the changes. I then exited and saved.

I examined *.c.rej and manually applied the rejected patches.

emacs src/*.c.rej
emacs src/diff.c
emacs src/diff3.c

I remove untracked files

$ git clean -f -n
$ git clean -f

git status shows 6 files

I git diff'ed into a file

$ git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
$ wc -l quote-3.0-patch.txt
326 quote-3.0-patch.txt

I read README-hacking and found the build instructions

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

I ran these commands on lnxsrv08 so no extra patch was needed.

I verify that my local diffutils does the right thing

$ ./src/diff . -
./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

$ ./src/diff --help

the help page had the correct quotations.

To compare the source code of Diffutils 3.0 to the source code of my modified version, I cloned the repository again

$ mv diffutils diffutils-3.0-patch
$ git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutils-3.0
$ gd diffutils-3.0
$ git checkout v3.0

$ diffutils-3.0-patch/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt

I compared quote-3.0-test.txt and quote-3.0-patch.txt

$ diff -u quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils-3.0-patch/quote-3.0-patch.txt | less

The files are not identical. There are changes of ` to ' in the patch
text file in the strings in the code.

Therefore, these are not innocous changes.
